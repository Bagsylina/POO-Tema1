# RPG Boss Rush

The project consists of a game of repeated battles against enemies. You have multiple types of attacks, that use MP, and the enemies can be weak or strong against certain types of attacks. If the first attack of either the player or the enemy hits a weak spot or is a critical attack, they can gain an additional consectuive turn. You can also guard, which heals a bit of HP and MP and reduces the damage of the next attack, use an item, which heals HP and MP depending on the consumable, or see all the stats of both you and the enemy, which also grants the additional consecutive turn.
